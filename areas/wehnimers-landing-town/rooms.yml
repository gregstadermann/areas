  description: "This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end of the space, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep."

  description: "Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its serpentine lanes abuzz with traders bartering, bickering, and hawking their wares.  The freewheeling vendors in the bazaar provide a lively alternative to the somewhat stodgier merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square."

Facing the square are some of the town's more prosperous and bustling shops."

  description: "This corner of the square is lively and hectic.  A number of representatives of the Landing's population, including several elven loggers and a party of rough-looking dwarves, loiter around the door of the Raging Thrak Inn, where the rowdy cheers of patrons and voices raised in songs of many sorts, from snatches of heroic ballads to blushingly bawdy tunes, beckon you to enter."

  description: "The entrance to Tykel's Arms, its heavy door bounded by iron-barred windows, dominates this corner of the square.  All manner of citizens pass by, moving among the solid, multistoried wooden buildings that surround the bazaar.  Just to the southwest can be seen the tree-shaded heart of the square, where citizens and adventurers gather for socializing, healing and rest.  You also see a narrow alleyway."

  description: "Foot and wagon traffic swarms off in all directions here, some going to the large intersection with South Ring Road, others crisscrossing the square via the bazaar. Men and women carrying neatly tied parcels or sacks and coils of rope slung over their arms emerge from the wooden facade of the old general store."

  description: "The street runs between the northern palisade and the central square to the south and east.  The traffic is varied here, as shoppers, traders, travelers and merchants mix with the ever-present and watchful militiamen.  The pristine walls of the Stone Baths occupy nearly the entire block.  You also see a brightly lit small painted wagon and a tall black bulwark tower."

The main path curves along the north and west walls, and another leads south between the buildings.  The massive oak and modwir logs of the city palisade tower overhead.

Guardsmen come and go through the main gates, keeping a close eye on the people of all races who move to and fro.  Opposite the gates, you see the shop of Dakris the Furrier."

  description: "Vigilant guardsmen scrutinize the citizens and travelers arriving and departing through the wide gates spanning the land route into Wehnimer's Landing.  The frenetic pace of the city to the south is a far cry from the deceptive calm of the wilds of Elanith outside.  Two daunting towers survey the countryside and protect the town, flanking the road to the east and west."

A collection of plaques hangs above an immense grey marble mantel cluttered with trophy cups and bowls.  Fashioned from a single stone slab, the hearth extends to an impressive black bear rug with its maw frozen in a silent roar.  Several overstuffed wingback chairs, each covered in deep jewel-tone chintz, are scattered about the room.  Against the back wall, a tall glass-front curio houses several ancient mementos and a thrak hide curtain hangs nearby."
