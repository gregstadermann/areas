  description: "This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end of the space, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep."

  description: "Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its serpentine lanes abuzz with traders bartering, bickering, and hawking their wares.  The freewheeling vendors in the bazaar provide a lively alternative to the somewhat stodgier merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square."

A number of representatives of the Landing's population, including several elven loggers and a party of rough-looking dwarves, loiter around the door of the Raging Thrak Inn, where the rowdy cheers of patrons and voices raised in songs of many sorts, from snatches of heroic ballads to blushingly bawdy tunes, beckon you to enter."
