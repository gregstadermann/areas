  title: Catacombs, Beneath the Well
  description: "The columnar stone shaft of an old well punctures the vaulted ceiling above and extends about halfway to the ground.  Directly beneath is the glassy surface of a spring-fed lake of unsurpassed crystalline beauty.  Diffuse light refracts off the lake and casts multihued reflections on the walls, as though filtered through a thousand tiny prisms of Elven devising.  The scene is so enchanting, you almost forget the harsh, muffled sounds echoing down the well.  You also see a cave gnome, a tiny stream flowing southwards into a muddy chamber, a wide darkened crevice and a stout rope hanging down from the well, just within your reach."

  title: Catacombs, Muddy Bend
  description: "Dirt and rock, held together by stout, ancient tree roots, are all that is left of the walls here. An old cave-in reduced the original tunnel to a mass of jumbled rubble beneath you. Mud and loose stones line the sides of the passage, and the earthen roof is just high enough for you to stand up. A thin trickle of glassy water flows eastward and down the rubble pile, from a large chamber just to the north."

  description: "A cave-in some time in the distant past must have sealed off the western extension of the manmade tunnel here. Pristinely clear water cascades in waves over the heap of rubble left in the wake of the collapse, forming a limpid pool at its base. Overflow from the pool runs off eastward down the center of the floor along a time-worn channel."

                drain off some of the running water. Two of the largest tunnels branch off from the main passage at this
